## Environment Variables

- **API Key:**  
  The app currently uses a demo WeatherAPI key hardcoded in `src/api/index.js`.  
  For production, replace it with your own key and consider using a `.env` file:
  ```
  REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```
  Update the API call in `src/api/index.js` to use `process.env.REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY`.

---

## Tests

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Uses Jest and React Testing Library.

## Known Issues / TODOs

- [ ] Move API key to environment variable for security.
- [ ] Add error handling for failed API requests.
- [ ] Improve accessibility and add dark mode.
- [ ] Add forecast (multi-day) view.
